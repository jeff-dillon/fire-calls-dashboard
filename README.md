This is a coding challenge for the Code Louisville Data Analysis 2 class. The 
goal of this challenge is to get experience creating dashboards in Tableau. 

## Introduction
In this exercise you will use and extend an existing data cleaning script to 
create a Tableau dashboard using Fire District Call data from the Louisville Open Data website. 

Data Source: 
[Louisville/Jefferson County Fire Districts calls for service](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/louisvillejefferson-county-fire-districts-calls-service) 

### Step 1: Tableau Setup

Create an account on the [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) website and downlaod the app.


### Step 2: Script Setup

Clone this repo, create a virtual environment, and install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

### Step 3: Clean the Data

Run the `clean-data.py` script to generate the `fire_dashboard.csv` file fo use in Tableau.

### Challenge: Create a Dashboard

Create a Tableau dashboard with multiple visualizations of the data. Example visualizations include:

- Geographic heatmap of calls by zip
- Line graph of calls by month
- Heatmap of calls by priority
- Heatmap of calls by Category

Your dashboard can include dynamic filtering, sorting graph elements, and other Tableau features.

### Bonus: Extend the Script and Dashboard

Update the cleaning script to include a new column called `TIME_TO_CLEAR_CATEGORY`. This column should categorize each record based on the `TIME_TO_CLEAR` column into the following categories:

- Less than 5
- 5 to 10
- 10 to 20
- 20 or more

Use this new column to create a Histogram visualization.
